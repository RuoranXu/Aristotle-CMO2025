Let convex quadrilateral \(ABCD\) be inscribed in a circle with center \(O\) and radius 1, satisfying \(\angle ABC < \angle BCD < 90^\circ\). Let \(P\) be the intersection of lines \(BA\) and \(CD\), and \(Q\) be the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). It is known that there exists a point \(K\) on segment \(BC\) such that \(P, A, K, D\) are concyclic, and \(KB \cdot KC = \frac{1}{2}OP^2\). Draw the perpendicular from \(Q\) to \(BC\), which intersects line \(OP\) at point \(T\).

(1) Find all possible values of \(OP\);
(2) Find all possible values of \(TB + TC\).
